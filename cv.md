## About me:
  My first full-fledged experience related to front-end development began at a course in Minsk. For 9 months of study, I combined with work and training. It was hard, but there was a goal to change profession. With each module it was harder, but the fire in the eyes and the desire did not give up. But on the last graduation module where they wrote work on React and Redux. I realized that I did not have time for everything and I decided to take a break and quit my job, because it became impossible to combine. I quit after 2 months. And began to completely repeat everything from scratch at home, already having an understanding of how and what works.
